#List in Python

==> Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
==> Lists are one of 4 buit-in data types in python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [ TUPLES , SET , and DICTIONARY ] all with different qualities and usage

==> Lists are the simplest containers that are an integral part of the python language.
==> A single List may contains DataTypes Like -> Integers,Strings, as well as objects.
==> Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered even after their creation.

==> Store Multiples data in One variables with help of 4-data types => [ List,Tuples,Dictionary,Set ]
==> List is uses of  # SQUARE BRACKETS [ ] -> Brackets
==> List items is SEPARATE by COMMAS (,)

 # Functions of List
 ==> List items are Ordered, Changeable, and allow Duplicate values .

  # Ordered ->
              when we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change
               EX => a = [ a,b,c,1,8,9,10 ] -> 1,2,3,4,5,6,7   ( this is the order of list ) 

  # Changeable ->
              the list is changeable,meaning that we can change, add , and remove items in a list after it has been created.
  # Allow Duplicates ->
              since lists are Indexed, lists can have items with the same value.

                                                                  Negative index => -5 -4 -3 -2 -1         -> Right to Left
